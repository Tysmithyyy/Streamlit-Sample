This Streamlit sample app was created to show some of the uses and capabilities of Streamlit in simple data applications. 

It features a dashboard view that retrieves weather data remotely and builds a simple dashboard with metrics and a "temperature over time" visualization. 

The next tab features a scrolling style dashboard with multiple charts that might work better for more data. It also includes export functionality to convert the data into a downloadable csv.
